    description: |-
      LiGround is a modern, cross-platform chess variant GUI for lichess variants and regional variants.
      As it is a rather new project the set of features is rather limited, but working well for basic analysis and game play.
      Compatible with UCI engines, especially Fairy-Stockfish, since LiGrounds rule implementation is based on it.
